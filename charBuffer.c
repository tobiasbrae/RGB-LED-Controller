// ==================================== [charBuffer.c] =============================
/*
*	This library implements a lightweight circular buffer for chars. The main usage is
*	to handle the chars, which have to be transmitted or were received on a
*	microcontroller via UART.
*
*	Usage:
*	To use the char-buffer, you have to declare a variable that stores the struct
*	"cb_charBuffer" as well as a char-array, which will contain the chars. After
*	calling "cb_initBuffer(...)" with the right parameters, you can use the other
*	functions.
*
*	CAUTION: There is no error handling for errors caused through missing cb_charBuffer
*				or buffer-array. You have to make sure that the buffer is initialized
*				correctly.
